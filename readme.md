# TODOS app

## Usage

Start a server to use this app. You might use a vs code extension called live server

When you run the server, will see the default app with the delete item feature enabled.

Usin a console you will be able to download the following branches:

- feat/delete-todo
- feat/js-object-database

The first branch has all changes used to add the delete item requirement.

The second branch has all changes used to switch from localStorage to a javascript object as database. This change also removes persistance from the app and all todos added will be lost when you refresh the app.
